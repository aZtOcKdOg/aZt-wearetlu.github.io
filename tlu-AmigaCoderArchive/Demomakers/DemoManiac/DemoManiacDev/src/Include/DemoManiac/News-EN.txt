New features:

   -New InternLibrary commands for font handling. 
   
   -PutChar returns blitted width (perhaps the routine 
    now works with prop fonts?! The structure is 
    read correctly anyway) 
   
   -Variable support (No output effect yet) 
    If changing a parameter during the run is possible - simply 
    write deznumV instead of deznum...

   -LESS BUGS! (some killed again)
  
   -Password protection (filtered out at the moment by conditional assembly)
  
   -F-key support 

   -First menu items (don't mess around with them - some still have NIL pointers...)

   -Edit color requester almost finished...

   -SWITCH parameter - I haven't managed to get the gadget boxes right 
    (I started 24:3:94 23:20:00) but this parameter will be expanded 
    later...

   -Script commands basically built in (only sound fading so far...) 

   -6 layers (note 4&5 still have problems sometimes) but all structures 
    have been expanded and all codes revised.

   -Correct color zero calculation built in (C0 is taken from the lowest 
    layer). (previously: always black)

   -Env structure slightly changed (because of the 6 layers I had to 
    desecrate some previously unused entry...)

   -For debugging purposes, patterns can now be interrupted during the 
    blitter waiting time... (with BOTH mouse buttons)
